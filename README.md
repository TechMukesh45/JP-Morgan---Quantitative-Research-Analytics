# JPMorgan Quantitative Risk Analytics – Virtual Internship Projects

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a collection of **end-to-end quantitative finance and risk analytics projects** completed as part of the **JPMorgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research Virtual Internship (Forage)**.

The projects simulate real-world problems faced by trading desks and risk management teams at global investment banks, focusing on:
- Commodity pricing and storage contracts
- Predictive credit risk modeling
- Probability of Default (PD) estimation
- Risk-based feature engineering and bucketing

All solutions are implemented in **Python**, documented professionally, and designed with **production and regulatory considerations** in mind.

## 🧠 Business Context
JPMorgan teams rely on quantitative researchers to:
- Price complex financial instruments
- Assess and manage credit risk
- Build interpretable and robust models
- Support regulatory and capital decisions

This repository demonstrates my ability to:
- Translate business problems into quantitative models
- Apply data science techniques in a financial risk context
- Communicate results clearly to technical and non-technical stakeholders

## 📊 Project Summaries

---

### 🔹 Task 1: Natural Gas Price Analysis & Forecasting
**Objective:**  
Analyze historical natural gas prices and build a function to estimate gas prices for any given date, including extrapolation into the future.

**Key Highlights:**
- Time-series analysis of monthly gas prices
- Seasonality identification
- Interpolation & extrapolation logic
- Date-based price estimation function
- Visual exploration of price trends

**Skills Used:**  
`Time Series Analysis`, `Data Visualization`, `Financial Reasoning`

---

### 🔹 Task 2: Natural Gas Storage Contract Pricing
**Objective:**  
Build a pricing model for a physical gas storage contract considering injection/withdrawal schedules and operational costs.

**Key Highlights:**
- Cash-flow–based contract valuation
- Support for multiple injection & withdrawal dates
- Storage capacity and rate constraints
- Cost modeling (storage, injection, withdrawal)
- Modular, production-style pricing function

**Skills Used:**  
`Financial Engineering`, `Cash Flow Modeling`, `Optimization Thinking`

### 🔹 Task 3: Credit Risk Modeling (Probability of Default)
**Objective:**  
Predict the Probability of Default (PD) for retail loan customers and compute Expected Loss.

**Key Highlights:**
- Exploratory data analysis of borrower characteristics
- Feature selection and preprocessing
- PD modeling using classification techniques
- Expected Loss (EL) computation with assumed recovery rate
- Risk-focused evaluation metrics

**Skills Used:**  
`Credit Risk`, `Machine Learning`, `Statistical Modeling`

### 🔹 Task 4: FICO Score Bucketing & Rating System
**Objective:**  
Convert continuous FICO scores into categorical credit ratings suitable for risk models requiring discrete inputs.

**Key Highlights:**
- Quantile-based FICO bucketing
- Monotonic PD validation
- Rating-to-PD mapping
- Expected Loss integration
- KS statistic and stability checks
- Production-ready rating assignment logic

**Skills Used:**  
`Risk Quantization`, `Feature Engineering`, `Model Governance`

---

## 📈 Key Results & Insights
- Demonstrated strong monotonic relationship between FICO score buckets and default probability
- Built interpretable, regulator-friendly credit rating buckets
- Designed reusable pricing and risk estimation functions
- Applied real banking assumptions used in capital and provisioning models

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📚 Key Concepts Applied
- Probability of Default (PD)
- Expected Loss (EL)
- Commodity pricing
- Storage contract valuation
- Credit risk modeling
- Risk bucketing and quantization
- Model interpretability and governance
